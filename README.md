# email-spam-classifier-new
End to end code for the email spam classifier project

The main goal of this project is to detect the class of text message that is Spam or Ham based on content of message. Spam is a junk mail/message, or an unsolicited mail/message. Spam e-mails are also those unwanted, unsolicited e-mails that are not intended for a specific receiver. The good, perfect, and official mails are known as ham. Our objective is to alert user from spam or junk mail/messages so that they can save themselves from being cheated from spammers.
